<div className='divv'>
<p className='ppp'>Okay, so last week we talked about the cratering ad revenue on Twitter, and then, just after I published, another major ad agency paused Twitter spending. 
    But I wrote last week's column to tee up the thing I actually want to talk about: 
    the long-term plan to make Twitter less dependent on advertising.</p>
    <p className='ppp'>On October 29th, Musk pal Jason Calacanis said on his podcast, All-In, “There’s no doubt that, I think, Elon can turn this around pretty quickly and make it massively profitable.” 
        Even when he said it, it wasn't quite true. Elon Musk already had a foray in media: the notable failure Thud, which apparently never had a plan to be profitable. After the events of the last couple weeks, 
        I feel like I'm dunking on Calacanis just by quoting him. But whatever, we’re less than a month in, and it’s possible that in the long term Calacanis is right, 
        I am going to do my best to take this all seriously.</p>
        <br></br>
        <h1 className='hd3'>What has Musk said so far about Twitter and payments?</h1>
        <br></br>
        <p className='ppp'>At Musk’s first meeting with Twitter employees, he did discuss his ambitions to make Twitter a place for payments. It’s a “high priority!” More to the point:</p>
        <p className='ppp'>In that speech, Musk indicates that he’s aware of the possibilities of people buying credit card information and scamming, so that’s good! But he also says he’s going to recycle his old plans for user acquisition, saying that in order to acquire users, he’s going to “give them some amount of money, like 10 bucks or something, that they can send anywhere in the system.”

Twitter needs money transfer licenses for that, which Musk says he’s applied for. But his ambitions sound bigger than just payments — he wants high-yield money market accounts “so that having a Twitter balance is the highest-yield thing that you can do,” he says. And, you know, debit cards, and checks, and maybe eventually loans. 
But payments, Musk says, would make Twitter more friendly to e-commerce.</p><br></br>
<h1 className='hd3'>Crypto???</h1><br></br>
<p className='ppp'>When I wrote up my stupid little outline for this story last week, I thought it might be nice to end on a hopeful note. So I was going to say something about how crypto Twitter is actually growing. And in Musk’s texts to his brother Kimbal, he says, “I think a new social media company is needed that is based on a blockchain and includes payments.”

In this vision, users pay a “tiny amount” to register their messages on a blockchain. (Musk thinks this will cut out “the vast majority of spam and bots”; I disagree, and I think the recent hijinks around Twitter Blue prove my point, but whatever.) I can sort of imagine this like a blockchain Venmo — where part of the fun is watching other people transact.
 Make a UI that’s friendly and onboard the normies, sure, why not! </p>

<h1 className='hd3 h1'><b>The best wireless earbuds to buy right now</b></h1>
<div>
    <br></br>
    <h1 className='h2'><b>1. Sony WF-1000XM4</b></h1><br></br>
    <p className='ppp'>Though they come at a hefty price, the best overall wireless earbuds you can buy are Sony’s WF-1000XM4. 
        They offer superb, warm, detailed sound quality and excellent active noise cancellation. 
        The ANC doesn’t quite measure up to Bose’s newer QC Earbuds II, but it’s still plenty powerful. 
        And their impressive battery life can stretch to eight hours of continuous listening with noise cancellation turned on, 
        enough to outlast all of Sony’s top competition. <br></br>
        The WF-1000XM4s have a premium, matte black (or light gray) design with stylish rose gold accents. Most earbuds come with standard silicone ear tips, but Sony includes foam-style tips that expand in your ears to create an excellent seal that, together with the noise cancellation, do an impressive job at hushing the outside world. Not everyone finds Sony’s ear tips the most comfortable — they’re on the larger size — so be sure to try them for yourself if possible.

On Android phones, the 1000XM4s support Sony’s LDAC codec for higher-quality music playback. But even when used on other platforms, they’re up there with the very best audio-focused premium earbuds like Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 2 — with much better noise cancellation. <br></br>

And just recently, Sony announced it would address the one main downside of the 1000XM4s: their lack of multipoint. Support for that is coming soon, so you’ll be able to pair them with two Bluetooth devices simultaneously. With their best-in-class mix of features (including bonuses like 360 Reality Audio support),
 improved voice call performance, and impressive battery endurance, you can’t do much better. </p>

 <h1 className='h2'><b>2. Jabra Elite 3</b></h1><br></br>
 <p className='ppp'>Sometimes all you need are the fundamentals, and that’s where Jabra’s Elite 3 earbuds manage to rise 
    above the crowded field of sub-$100 competition. Their sound puts some emphasis on the bass but still 
    manages to come through nicely
     balanced overall with very good clarity for this price range.</p>
     <p className='ppp'>The earbuds last for up to seven hours of continuous playback, and the compact case holds three additional charges. Their large physical buttons are easy to use, and the earbuds are rated IP55 for dust and water resistance. 

The Elite 3s lack the multipoint feature that Jabra has long been known for — that’s the main sacrifice you make for the price — but in an improvement from past models, 
either earbud can be used standalone in mono mode. And they’re extremely comfortable to wear for long stretches. You don’t get features like active noise cancellation or wireless charging (though Jabra does include a so-so transparency mode), but the Elite 3s perform reliably with a strong Bluetooth signal. 
They’re a terrific value for the money. </p>
